## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
file.choose()
```

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("/Users/sanjanarayala/Downloads/educational-attainment-by-level-of-education-cumulative-population-25/Educational attainment by level of education, cumulative (% population 25+).csv")
```

```{r}
names(data)
```

```{r}
names(data)

```


```{r}
data <- janitor::clean_names(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = education_rate)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
labs(
title = "Distribution of Education Rates",
x = "Education Rate (%)",
y = "Number of Countries"
) +
theme_minimal()
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
