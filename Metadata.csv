Statistical concept(s): Educational attainment indicators by education level, serve as a measure of the accumulated stock of knowledge, skills, and competencies that are typically associated with the completion of each level. These indicators not only shed light on the disparities in educational achievement among various demographic groups, thereby offering insights into the present and past efficacy of the education system in ensuring equitable access to education, but they also mirror the structure and performance of the education system itself. Furthermore, such indicators are instrumental in guiding policy decisions aimed at expanding educational opportunities.","","","","",""
