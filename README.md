# STAT107_Project: Education Attainment vs Income Inequality

This repository contains all code, data, and documentation for the STAT 107 final project. The goal of this project is to determine whether higher levels of national educational attainment are associated with lower wealth inequality, using primary education completion rates and Gini coefficients from 144 countries.

The final report summarizes the statistical methods, visualizations, and conclusions. All code used to clean, process, and analyze the data is included to ensure the results are fully reproducible.
