# STAT107_Project: Education Attainment vs Income Inequality

Wealth Inequality file:
The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, is a statistical measure of wealth distribution developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini. The Gini index is used to gauge economic inequality by measuring income distribution, also called wealth distribution. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. A coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, a country (or other people group) in which everyone had the same income. The closer to 1 the coefficient is, the greater the wealth inequality. Gini coefficient is also expressed as a percentage in which 0% is perfect equality and 100% would be the maximum possible inequality.

Education Attainment Level file:
This file shows the educational attainment levels of adults 25 years or older, shows the difference between sexes, and reflects several levels of education from Primary School to Doctoral.

For our project, we investigate the relationship between education rates and income inequality. The main question we aim to address is whether countries with greater income inequality tend to have lower levels of educational attainment. Using the Gini coefficient to measure each country’s wealth inequality, along with education indicators such as high school graduation and college enrollment rates, we conduct correlation and regression analyses to compare the two. Our results show a negative relationship, indicating that countries with higher wealth inequality often have lower education rates.

The purpose of this analysis is to examine the relationship between wealth inequality and education rates across various countries. Our main question is whether nations with greater income inequality tend to have lower levels of educational attainment. By studying this relationship, we aim to better understand how differences in economic conditions may affect access to education and overall learning outcomes. This analysis may be valuable for policymakers, educators, and researchers who are interested in promoting equality and improving educational systems. Identifying a correlation between income inequality and education can help guide strategies that promote more equal access to educational opportunities.

To analyze this question, we use statistical methods such as correlation and regression analysis to measure the strength and direction of the relationship between wealth inequality and education rates. Our hypothesis is that countries with higher levels of income inequality will generally have lower education rates. Wealth inequality will be represented by the Gini coefficient, while education levels will be measured using indicators such as high school graduation rates and college enrollment percentages.We plan to visualize the data using scatter plots and trend lines to observe general patterns. Our expected outcome is a negative correlation, suggesting that countries with higher income inequality tend to have lower education rates. This would support the hypothesis that unequal wealth distribution limits educational access.
